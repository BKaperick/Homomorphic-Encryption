Cryptanalysis Of FHE Schemes,"Ahmed El-Yahyaoui, Mohamed Dafir Elkettani",May-16,,
Efficient FHE From RLWE,"Xiaojun Zhang, Chunxiang Xu, Chunhua Jin, Run Xie, Jining Zhao",2014,,
Exploring The Feasibility Of FHE,"Wei Wang, Yin Hu, Lianmu Chen, Xinming Huang, Berk Sunar",Mar-15,,
FHE with Ideal Lattices,"Craig Gentry", 2009, "Details the first fully homomorphic scheme and introduces the squashing/bootstrapping technique to transform an SHE to FHE scheme.  Gets a bit more theoretical than the Integers paper, which makes it harder to follow.", 7/10
FHE Over The Integers,"Marten van Dijk, Craig Gentry, Shai Halevi, Vinod Vaikuntanathan",2010,"Gives a full and detailed outline of a somewhat homomorphic scheme using an integer ring, and discusses at length the types of attacks they have considered, and prove all their results using bit-wise arithmetic.  The largest practical concern is the level of noise and the implications of different parameter choices.  Overall I am able to follow their methods, and the majority of details and motivations for each design decision.",8/10
Guide To FHE,,,"Overview of the field and current research and applications.  Does not go into any implementation detail, but takes great care to give a formal introduction to the problem itself and what challenges one encounters in solving it.  Gives a lot of definitions and theorems summarizing current research, which is very helpful.",8
HE Procedia Computer Science,"Monique Ogburn, Claude Turner, Pushkar Dahal",2013,,
HE And Its Applications,"Xun Yi, Russell Paulet, Elisa Bertino",2014,"Book on FHE but does not appear to be extremely detailed",4/10
